Driver: Andrew
Passenger: Vivian
Route: pdx1
Task: 20 questions (Vivian asking)
Time: 10-ish minutes??
- decent amount of back and forth, but maybe only because of Andrew's style of answering questions (not just yes/no answers)
- "The passenger needs to know how polite to be to help the driver drive"
- "It's weird to go backwards" -> moderately disconcerting
- "There needs to be more time at intersections to turn"
- "Notifications were interruptive -> felt like a real map"
- "not hard to get back to the game after being interrupted"
- probably need MORE interruptions
